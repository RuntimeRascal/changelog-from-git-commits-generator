### Checking in code

the project has a custom commitizen configuration and this requires commits are formatted accordingly.

First:
1. make sure you have globally installed `commitizen`
2. next, either use terminal thorugh `git cz` command then follow prompts, or run `yarn run commit` in case you forget the `cz` command syntax.

you can still make commits as normal or in tooling, however, they have to be formatted according to the config and the commit linter should help with this.
